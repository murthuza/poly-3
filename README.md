# Polygon Advanced Module 3 Project: zkSNARK Circuit Implementation

## Description
This project involves designing and deploying a zkSNARK circuit using the Circom programming language. The circuit will implement specific logical operations, and you will deploy an on-chain verifier to verify the proofs generated by the circuit. Finally, the contract will be deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **Hardhat** installed
- Access to the **Sepolia testnet**
- **MetaMask** wallet with Sepolia testnet configured

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:
```bash
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```

## Circuit Implementation

### 3. Implement the Logic Gate
1. Navigate to the `circom` directory.
2. Modify the appropriate `.circom` file to implement the required logical gate(s).
3. Ensure your circuit is well-optimized and tested locally before proceeding.

## Hardhat Configuration

### 4. Configure Hardhat for Sepolia Testnet
Edit the `hardhat.config.ts` file to include the Sepolia network configuration:
```typescript
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: "https://rpc2.sepolia.org/", // Replace with your RPC URL
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY], // Use your wallet's private key
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

Ensure you have your private key stored securely in a `.env` file and that the `dotenv` package is properly configured:
1. Install `dotenv`:
    ```bash
    npm install dotenv
    ```
2. Create a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key" > .env
    ```
3. Import and configure `dotenv` at the top of `hardhat.config.ts`:
    ```typescript
    require('dotenv').config();
    ```

### 5. Compile the Circuit
Compile the zkSNARK circuit by running:
```bash
npx hardhat circom
```
This step will generate the necessary proof and verification keys.

## Contract Deployment

### 6. Deploy the Verifier Contract
Deploy the contract on the Sepolia testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
```
If the deployment is successful, Hardhat will output the contract address.

## Verification and Output

### 7. Verify the Result
Once the contract is deployed, verify the result by interacting with the verifier smart contract. If everything is set up correctly, the verifier should return `true` for valid proofs.

### Expected Output
- **Contract Address:** The address where the verifier contract is deployed on the Sepolia testnet.
- **Verifier Result:** `true` (indicating a successful proof verification).
